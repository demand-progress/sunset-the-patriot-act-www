            This is a fight of our lives. People hate the Patriot Act — it’s what
            the NSA has used to violate the Constitution and monitor our private
            lives day in and day out for the past 14 years. But, after our epic
            outcry and a showdown last week, we’re on the verge of reaching a
            milestone that's always seemed out of reach: the Patriot Act is
            poised to sunset at midnight on June 1st. Now, the NSA's shills are
            making a final attempt this Sunday at the 11th hour to re-up on the
            Patriot Act. We need you more than ever to help secure this first
            historic move away from mass surveillance.

            Americans were outraged to learn that the NSA has been spying on <em>all of us</em>.  But Congress is on the verge of reauthorizing some of the worst parts of the PATRIOT Act for another five years.
            Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act &mdash; that's the authority that the NSA exploits to collect data about almost all of our <a href="#" class="open-call-tool">phone calls</a> &mdash; expires on June 1st.

    <h2>The single most important<br/>thing you can do.</h2>
    <p>
        This is a fight of our lives to decide if mass surveillance is a part of our
        future or not, and we've never been this close to actually sunsetting the Patriot
        Act. The most impactful thing any of us can do right now to make sure it
        happens is if we show up at our senators and reps offices while they're home
        in district this week. We only have a few days until Sunday. Will you go and
        deliver this letter to them?

    <h3>Last week, we protested around the country, and won precious time</h3>
    <p>
        Protests happened at sunset at Senate offices around the country. Senate leader
        Mitch McConnell forced the Senate into an unusual late night session, but
        **failed** to renew the PATRIOT Act. Now, the deadline approaches fast.

    <h2>Spread the word.</h2>

    <p>
        If Congress maintains the bulk collection provisions of the PATRIOT Act, it's game over for our privacy. Whether
        you're browsing the Internet, sending a text message, or buying a book, the
        government could be watching. Don't let Congress undermine the Constitution.
        Help us share this action with as many people as possible!

                It’s an outrage that Congress is considering renewing key PATRIOT Act provisions and continuing to allow the NSA to spy on all of us.  I demand that you vote against reauthorization, and let Section 215 and other provisions expire once and for all.

            <p class="nopad">
                But making a phone call is at least 10 times as powerful as sending a letter.  Will you call your lawmakers to tell them to let the Patriot Act sunset?  We'll connect you to them and give you a script.  It'll just take a couple of minutes &mdash; and could end mass surveillance.

            <h1>We're calling you now.</h1>
            <p class="nopad">
                We'll connect you to one of your senators, then your other senator, and then your representative.  Don’t hang up between calls — just press <strong>*</strong> after each call is over to move on to the next one.  You can say:
                <br>
                <br>
                “It’s an outrage that Congress is considering renewing key Patriot Act provisions and continuing to allow the NSA to spy on all of us.  I demand that you vote against reauthorization, and let Section 215 and other provisions expire once and for all."
                <br>
                <br>
                It'd be great if you could make more calls once you're done with your own lawmakers.  If you're able, just keep clicking * after each call, and keep on calling!
