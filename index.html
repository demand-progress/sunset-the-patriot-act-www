    <h2>Break Congress' Internet</h2>
    <h3>&mdash; When it matters most. &mdash;</h3>
    <p>
        No one has the right to spy on our private lives, US law says so. But, Congress is days away from a carte blanche reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act, an assault on the US Constitution that would put us under mass surveillance for years. To stop them, the web is blocking Congress' IP addresses from our usual content to show them a message they can't ignore. This is our moment &mdash; sign up now.

    <h2>Spread the word.</h2>

    <p>
        If Congress renews the PATRIOT Act, it's game over for our privacy. Whether
        you're browsing the Internet, sending a text message, or buying a book, the
        government will be watching. Don't let Congress undermine the Constitution.
        Help us share this action with as many people as possible!

    <h2>What's happening?</h2>
    
    <p>Things are bad, but they're not unfixable. That's because this is a fight of corruption over freedom. Defense companies like Lockheed Martin and Booz Allen sold us a culture of fear and bought off politicians to do the same in order to justify the creation of an industrialized surveillance system. Since then, the've given us false security for profit, a bargain that has led to a surveillance system that is being abused to to monitor everyone, the kind of system that is usually reserved for dictatorships. 
</p>
<p>
The US Constitution says that there shall be no search and seizure without a probable cause. That's why Edward Snowden's revalations about the US' mass government surveillance of our private lives shocked the world. Since then, we learned what laws the government has abused to justify conducting these programs - the Patriot Act, the FISA Amendments Act, and Executive Order 1233. The Patriot Act was passed shortly after the 9/11 attacks, with minimal vetting and within a few days of being introduced.  The NSA exploits Section 215 of the Patriot Act to spy on all Americans, by collecting information about our phone records.  Other provisions have been used to collect information about our emails and to engage in other unjustifiable surveillance of ordinary Americans.
</p>

    <h2>Now, what?</h2>
<p>
Key Patriot Act Provisions Are About to Expire. On June 1 three Patriot Act provisions are set to expire — including Section 215.  Congress is considering reauthorizing it with no, or with minimal, changes and without addressing other critical surveillance programs — like warrantless wiretapping or email and other collection under Executive Order 12333 — or making the intelligence agencies more accountable. 
</p><p>
There are multiple bills being introduced in both the House and Senate, and the process moving forward will be complicated and frequently unpredictable more than a day or two ahead of time.  We’ll update the site to reflect key changes in the state of play and make sure that actions are targeted to have the most impact.

                Awesome! So, here's the deal &mdash; we're building a twitter army.
                To make sure Washington and the world sees a message they can't ignore,
                thousands of people have agreed to let us send out urgent alerts on their
                twitter at key moments in the fight. We need you too &mdash; to join,
                you'll be asked to authorize our automatic tweet tool on the next
                screen so we can post these messages for you and the open Internet at
                those key moments (you can quit at any time). This is our time to use
                the Internet to defend itself and our basic freedom to express ourselves
                and build the world around us. Hit next to go to the next screen!
