            We have &mdash; temporarily &mdash; done away with Section 215 of the Patriot Act.  That's pretty amazing and something we should all be proud of.  But the Senate will vote on restoring it this week, and will consider amendments to make the USA FREEDOM Act (the fake reform bill we've been opposing) even worse.

            Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's amendments would keep the operations of the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court &mdash; the court that blessed the collection of our phone records &mdash; secret, and delay implementation of certain modest constraints on mass surveillance.

    <p>
        If Congress maintains the bulk collection provisions of the PATRIOT Act, it's game over for our privacy. Whether
        you're browsing the Internet, sending a text message, or buying a book, the
        government could be watching. Don't let Congress undermine the Constitution.
        Help us share this action with as many people as possible!

                It’s an outrage that Congress is considering renewing key PATRIOT Act provisions and continuing to allow the NSA to spy on all of us.  I demand that you vote against reauthorization, and let Section 215 and other provisions expire once and for all.

                But making a phone call is at least 10 times as powerful as sending a letter.  Will you call your lawmakers to tell them to let the Patriot Act sunset?  We'll connect you to them and give you a script.  It'll just take a couple of minutes &mdash; and could end mass surveillance.

                <p>
                    First we're going to connect you to your senators. Please tell them:

                <br>
                <p class="quote">
                    "I urge you to oppose Mitch McConnell's amendments to weaken the USA FREEDOM Act, and to vote against the USA FREEDOM Act altogether. Now that Section 215 has sunset, a vote for the USA FREEDOM Act is a vote to create new authorities for the surveillance of the American people."

                <br>
                <p>
                    If the Senate passes USA FREEDOM with any amendments, the House will vote on it again too. So after you've called the Senate, we will connect you to your House member, and then to other House members until you decide to hang up. Please tell them:
